### What I learned

This was the starter project with Frontend Mentor. It was a fun chance to keep things as simple as possible.

```css
@media (max-width: 576px) {
    .container {
        background: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
        height: 100%;
        margin: 0;
    }
}
```

### Continued development

I look forward to using this component in a larger project.
